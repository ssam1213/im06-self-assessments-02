학습한 내용들을 얼마나 이해했는지에 대해 평가하는 테스트가 정기적으로 있을 예정입니다.

테스트를 보는 과정은 기존의 git workflow 와 거의 동일합니다. 테스트를 수행하고 평가 등급을 스스로 매기는 부분만 한 가지 추가됩니다.

Pull Request 를 제출할때 스스로 평가 등급을 코멘트에 작성합니다. (ex. [Complete] filter-family-members, [Mostly complete] tree-map )

### Assessment Grading Scale

Qualitative grade  | Meaning
------------- | -------------
Complete  | You believe your solution to be fully complete and meeting the specified requirements.
Mostly complete  | Your solution is well on its way to being complete, but you ran out of time or can't remember exactly how to do one particular aspect. You believe anyone who understands the problem well would endorse your solution as the right one, and know pretty clearly how to finish up any last touches.
Significant progress  | You have the right idea and were heading in a good direction. Covers everything between Mostly Complete and Attempted.
Attempted  | You were very challenged by the prompt and had trouble making any significant progress on the problem, but wrote at least one meaningful line of code that appears to be a genuine attempt.
Not attempted  | Whether you've thought much about the problem or not, you have no lines of code to show for the problem. (Note, you should avoid ever getting into a situation where this is the grade you'd give yourself. Make a passing attempt at each problem before going back to complete any one problem.)

### Starting every problem
모든 문제에 조금이라도 시간을 투자해서 고민해봅니다. 실제 코드를 작성하지 못하더라도, 고민했던 흔적을 코멘트로 남기거나, pseudo-code 를 작성하는 것도 도움이 됩니다.
